tba.v12: TBA -- threaded block alignment.
args: [+-] [R=?] [M=?] [E=?] [P=?] [X=?] species-guid-tree maf-source destination
	R(30) dynamic programming radius.
	M(1) minimum block length of output.
	E(null) null: no reference centric alignment, single coverage is guaranteed for every species; reference: refernece centric alignment, singe coverage is guaranteed for reference species.
	P(null) null: run multiz; P=multic specifies to run multic.
	X(0) utilize maf files with different suffix from differnt post processing.
		0: .sing.maf from single coverage pairwise alignment
		1: .toast.maf from full size toast
		2: .toast2.maf from reduced size toast
