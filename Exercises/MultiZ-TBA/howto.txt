# Run all pairwise alignments, with default parameters:
all_bz + F=HUMAN "((((HUMAN (MOUSE RAT)) COW) OPOSSUM) CHICKEN)"

# To see the list of all pairwise MAF files
ls -ltr

# To see the difference after removing overlaps
diff HUMAN.RAT.orig.maf HUMAN.RAT.sing.maf 

# Build the multiple alignments
tba "((((HUMAN (MOUSE RAT)) COW) OPOSSUM) CHICKEN)" *.sing.maf tba_all.maf

# Project them on human
maf_project tba_all.maf HUMAN > tba_human.maf

# The output will be a maf file with a fairly large amount of comment lines at the beginning.
# All the blocks should have a HUMAN entry. Check that by comparing the result of (148 in my test):
grep -c "a score" tba_human.maf
grep -c "s HUMAN" tba_human.maf
