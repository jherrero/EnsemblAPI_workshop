Ensembl API workshop
====================

Go to http://jherrero.github.io/EnsemblAPI_workshop/ to access the workshops.

Workshop files. Ensembl core API, Whole-genome alignments, Ensembl compara API (genomic alignments)

These files are based on the workshops I have run in the past while at the EBI. I am no longer affiliated with Ensembl nor the European Bioinformatics Insitute.

The web pages providing links to the material and exercises are available under the gh-pages branch and served directly from the GitHub Pages service.
